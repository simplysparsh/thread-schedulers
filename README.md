# Thread-Schedulers
In this project, we implement four types of thread schedulers for a uni-processor environment.

1. First Come First Served (FCFS) - no preemption
2. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) - with preemption
3. Priority Based Scheduling (PBS) - with preemption, and
4. Multi Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) - with preemption and aging

### Note about Tests
The test files inside the Test folder are compressed. That's because `git` doesn't handle those files
very well. To use, simply download and uncompress. Do not push the uncompressed files back to the repository.
